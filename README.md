# Project_Deep_Learning
The main goal was to build a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) in Python using Tensorflow and Keras able to recognize facial expressions - 7 different emotions. 
Finally we built a model based on images from Kaggle's Facial Expression Recognition competition which took place in 2013. 
Code available in this repository allows you to train a CNN model which achieves 65.59% accuracy on the final testset.
